    "\n",
    "Our current Sudoku solver uses a brute-force recursive backtracking approach. At each empty cell, it attempts all digits from 1 to 9 and recursively continues until the board is either solved or proven unsolvable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **worst-case scenario**, where `k` is the number of empty cells, the time complexity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "O(9^k)\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "#### Limitations of the Current Approach\n",

    "\n",
    "- It may explore many unnecessary branches before reaching a solution.\n",
    "- It can take significantly longer on hard or minimally-filled boards.\n",
    "- It tries all numbers 1 to 9 in every empty cell, regardless of how obvious the choice might be."

    "## 6. Optimization Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "While optimizing the Sudoku solver, I reflected on my own experience of playing Sudoku puzzles manually. I was already familiar with **human solving strategies** such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naked Singles**\n",
    "- **Hidden Singles**\n",
    "- **Naked Pairs**  \n",
    "...and other logic-based techniques commonly used in mobile Sudoku games and by human solvers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These strategies allow us to solve many cells **without any guessing** — simply by applying deduction.  \n",
    "So my **initial thought** was: *\"Why not apply these exact same logic rules to solve the puzzle?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I quickly realized something important:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Relying **only on human strategies** often gets stuck, especially in harder puzzles where some level of **guessing or search** becomes unavoidable.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, I recalled what I had learned in my **4th semester AI course** — particularly about **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)** and **heuristic search**.  \n",
    "I recalled Sudoku is a textbook CSP example, and techniques like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimum Remaining Value (MRV)**\n",
    "- **Least Constraining Value (LCV)**\n",
    "- **Forward Checking**\n",
    "\n",
    "...are all designed to intelligently reduce the search space and solve puzzles more efficiently using **backtracking + heuristics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I had a thought:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"Why not combine both approaches?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "That led me to design a **hybrid solution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use human strategies** (e.g., Naked Singles, Hidden Singles) to eliminate obvious cells early — just like a human would.\n",
    "2. Then apply **heuristic-based recursive backtracking** to handle the remaining tricky cells with maximum efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "By shrinking the board with logic and then solving it intelligently with CSP heuristics, the solver becomes **much faster and more elegant**, especially on hard puzzles.\n",

    "### Phase: Implementing Human Sudoku Solving Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implemented logical human-like Sudoku solving techniques to reduce search space by filling obvious cells.\n",
    "- Strategies implemented:\n",
    "  - **Naked Singles**: Fill cells where only one candidate number is possible.\n",
    "  - **Hidden Singles**: Find cells where a candidate number appears uniquely in a row, column, or box.\n",
    "  - **Naked Pairs**: Identify pairs of cells in a row, column, or box sharing exactly two candidates, allowing elimination of these candidates from other cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What I Did\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created functions for each strategy:\n",
    "  - `naked_single(board)`\n",
    "  - `hidden_single(board)`\n",
    "  - `naked_pair(board)` (including row, column, and box logic)\n",
    "- Integrated these strategies into a loop applying them repeatedly until no more changes.\n",
    "- Tested strategies on easy, medium, and medium-hard Sudoku boards.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human strategies fill many cells, especially on easier puzzles.\n",
    "- For medium-hard and hard puzzles, these strategies alone are insufficient to fully solve the board.\n",
    "- The solver stalls with only logical strategies when guessing or advanced techniques are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human strategies are powerful pruning methods but not complete solvers.\n",
    "- Backtracking guarantees a solution but can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "- Combining both approaches — using human strategies first, then backtracking could be most efficient method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement a hybrid solver that:\n",
    "  - Applies human strategies repeatedly to simplify the puzzle.\n",
    "  - Switches to backtracking when no further logical progress is possible.\n",
    "- This approach might balance speed and completeness in solving Sudoku puzzles.\n"

    "## Transition to Heuristic Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing and testing human-style solving strategies — **naked singles**, **hidden singles**, and **naked pairs** — we observed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- These techniques are effective for solving **easy** and **some medium** boards.\n",
    "- However, they are not sufficient to solve **hard or minimal-clue boards** on their own.\n",
    "- Some cells still require **guessing and deeper exploration**, which logical strategies alone cannot handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle such cases, we now return to a more powerful approach — **backtracking** — but this time, we aim to make it **smarter and faster** by incorporating **heuristics** from **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MRV (Minimum Remaining Value)**: Choose the next empty cell with the fewest legal candidates.\n",
    "- **Forward Checking**: After assigning a value, eliminate it from the candidate sets of related cells.\n",
    "- **Combining with Human Strategies**: First use logic to reduce the puzzle, then apply backtracking only when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This hybrid approach aims to combine the **efficiency of human logic** with the **power of informed search**, resulting in a solver that is both **optimized** and **capable of handling all difficulty levels**.\n"
